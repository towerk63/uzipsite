      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>The following are the terms of an agreement between you and UZIP. By accessing, or using this Web site, you
        acknowledge that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by these terms and to comply with all
        applicable
        laws and regulations, including export and re-export control laws and regulations. If you do not agree to these
        terms, please do not use this Web site.</p>
      <p>UZIP may, without notice to you, at any time, revise these Terms of Use and any other information contained in
        this Web site. UZIP may also make improvements or changes in the products, services, or programs described in
        this
        site at any time without notice.</p>
      <h2>General</h2>
      <p>This Web site contains proprietary notices and copyright information, the terms of which must be observed and
        followed. Please see the tab entitled “Copyright and trademark information” for related information.</p>
      <p>UZIP grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited permission to access and display the Web pages
        within
        this site as a customer or potential customer of UZIP provided you comply with these Terms of Use, and all
        copyright, trademark, and other proprietary notices remain intact. You may only use a crawler to crawl this Web
        site as permitted by this Web site’s robots.txt protocol, and UZIP may block any crawlers in its sole
        discretion. The use authorized under this agreement is non-commercial in nature (e.g., you may not sell the
        content you access on or through this Web site.) All other use of this site is prohibited.</p>
      <p>Except for the limited permission in the preceding paragraph, UZIP does not grant you any express or implied
        rights or licenses under any patents, trademarks, copyrights, or other proprietary or intellectual property
        rights. You may not mirror any of the content from this site on another Web site or in any other media. Any
        software and other materials that are made available for downloading, access, or other use from this site with
        their own license terms will be governed by such terms, conditions, and notices. Your failure to comply with
        such terms or any of the terms on this site will result in automatic termination of any rights granted to you,
        without prior notice, and you must immediately destroy all copies of downloaded materials in your possession,
        custody or control.</p>
      <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>From time to time, this Web site may contain technical inaccuracies or typographical errors, and we do not
        warrant the accuracy of any posted information. Please confirm you are using the most up-to-date pages on this

        to
        services, products, or other matters described in this Web site.</p>
      <p>If any term in this Terms of Use is found by competent judicial authority to be unenforceable in any respect,
        the validity of the remainder of this Terms of Use will be unaffected, provided that such unenforceability
        does
        not materially affect the parties’ rights under this Terms of Use.</p>
      <h2>Forward-looking and cautionary statements</h2>
      <p>Except for historical information and discussions, statements set forth throughout this web site may
        constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of

        Securities and Exchange Commission. See the “SEC filings” tab under “Investor relations” on this Web site for
        copies of such filings.</p>
