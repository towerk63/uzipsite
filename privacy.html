      <h2>This Privacy Statement is effective as of 31 December 2019.</h2>
      <p>At UZIP we recognize the importance of protecting your personal information and are committed to processing it
        responsibly and in compliance with applicable data protection laws in all countries in which UZIP operates.</p>
      <p>This Privacy Statement describes UZIP's general privacy practices that apply to personal information we
        collect,
        use and share about consumers and other individuals within our clients, business partners, supplier and other
        organizations with which UZIP has or contemplates a business relationship.</p>
      <p>This Privacy Statement provides more information in the online context, including recruitment. We may provide
        additional or more specific information on the collection or use of personal information on websites or related
        to
        a specific product or service.</p>
      <h2>Why and how we collect and use your personal information</h2>
      <p>We may collect your personal information as an individual for various purposes, such as the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>Access and use of websites or other online services</h4>

            or
            service, to provide you with support, or to participate in a forum or other social computing tool, we
            collect information necessary to fulfill your request, to grant you access to the product or service, to

          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Visitor information</h4>
          <p>We register individuals visiting our sites and locations (name, identification and business contact
            information) and use camera supervision for reasons of security and safety of persons and belongings, as
            well
            as for regulatory purposes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Marketing</h4>
          <p>Most information we collect about you comes from our direct interactions with you. When you register for an
            event we may collect information (online or offline) in relation to the event organization, and during an
            event, such as participation in sessions and survey results. We combine the personal information we collect
            to
            develop aggregate analysis and business intelligence for conducting our business and for marketing purposes.
            You can choose to receive information by email, telephone or postal mail about our products and services, or
            sign-up for subscriptions. When visiting our websites or using our services we may provide you with
            personalized information.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Where we reference that we use your personal information in connection with a request, order, transaction or
        agreement (or preparing for the same), or to provide you with services that you requested (such as a website),
        we do this because it is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you.
        Where we reference that we use your personal information in relation to marketing, improvement or development of
        our products or services, for reasons of safety and security, or regulatory requirements other than in
        connection with your agreement or request, we do this on the basis of our or a third party’s legitimate
        interests, or with your consent.
      </p>
      <h2>Sharing of Personal Information</h2>
      <p>As a global organization offering a wide range of products and services, with business processes, management
        structures and technical systems that cross borders, UZIP has implemented global policies, along with standards
        and procedures, for consistent protection of personal information. As a global company, we may share information
        about you with our subsidiaries world-wide and transfer it to countries in the world where we do business in
        accordance with this Privacy Statement.</p>
      <p>Between UZIP controlled subsidiaries we only grant access to personal information on a need-to-know basis,
        necessary for the purposes for which such access is granted. In some cases, UZIP uses suppliers located in
        various
        countries to collect, use, analyze, and otherwise process personal information on its behalf.</p>
      <p>Where appropriate, UZIP may also share your personal information with selected partners to help us provide you,
        or
        the company you work for, products or services, or to fulfill your requests, or with your consent. When
        selecting
        our suppliers and partners, we take into account their data handling processes.</p>
      <p>If UZIP decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries, such a transaction
        may
        involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of such
        information from sellers. It is UZIP's practice to require appropriate protection for personal information in
        these types of transactions.</p>
      <p>Please be aware that in certain circumstances, personal information may be subject to disclosure to government
        agencies pursuant to judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process. We may also share your personal
        information to protect the rights or property of UZIP, our business partners, suppliers or clients, and others
        when we have reasonable grounds to believe that such rights or property have been or could be affected.</p>
      <h2>International Transfers</h2>
      <p>The international footprint of UZIP involves a large number of transfers of personal information between
        different subsidiaries, as well as to third parties located in the countries where we do business. Some
        countries have implemented transfer restrictions for personal information, in connection with which UZIP takes
        various measures, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Where required, UZIP implements Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the EU Commission, or similar
          contractual clauses in other jurisdictions. This includes transfers to suppliers or other third parties.
        </li>
        <li>UZIP complies with the <a style="color: blue;" href="http://cbprs.org/">APEC Cross Border Privacy Rules</a>
          (CBPR) system.
        </li>
        <li>• UZIP certified to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks. </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Information Security and Accuracy</h2>
      <p>We intend to protect your personal information and to maintain its accuracy. UZIP implements reasonable
        physical,
        administrative and technical safeguards to help us protect your personal information from unauthorized access,
        use
        and disclosure. For example, we encrypt certain sensitive personal information such as credit card information
        when we transmit such information over the Internet. We also require that our suppliers protect such information
        from unauthorized access, use and disclosure.</p>
      <h2>Retention Period</h2>
      <p>We will not retain personal information longer than necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it is
        processed,
        including the security of our processing complying with legal and regulatory obligations (e.g. audit, accounting
        and statutory retention terms), handling disputes, and for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal
        claims in the countries where we do business.</p>
      <p>Because the circumstances may vary depending on the context and the services, the information provided in a
        specific notice may provide more detailed information on applicable retention terms.</p>
      <h2>Your Rights</h2>
      <p>You can request to access, update, delete or correct your personal information. You also have the right to
        object to direct marketing.</p>
      <p>You may have additional rights pursuant to your local law applicable to the processing. For example, if the
        processing of your personal information is subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), and
        your personal information is processed based on legitimate interests, you have the right to object to the
        processing on grounds relating to your specific situation. Under GDPR you may also have the right to request to
        have your personal information deleted or restricted and ask for portability of your personal information.</p>
      <h2>Right to Lodge a Complaint</h2>
      <p>In the event you consider our processing of your personal information not to be compliant with the applicable
        data protection laws, you can lodge a complaint:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>With the competent data protection authority. The name and contact details of the Data Protection
          Authorities
          in the European Union.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Changes to our Privacy Statements</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Statement from time to time to reflect changes to our data governance practices. The
        revised Privacy Statement will be posted here with an updated revision date. We encourage you to check back
        periodically for any changes or updates. If we make a material change to our Privacy Statement, we will post a
        notice at the top of this page for 30 days. By continuing to use our websites after such revision takes effect
        we
        consider that you have read and understand the changes.</p>

                With a wide and global customer base, drone mapping platform
                DroneDeploy is continually identifying new uses for drone
                technology. Precision agriculture was one of the early
